## **Projects**

**KAMI (Kitchen Assistant and Meal Innovator) - AI Recipe Generator**

This capstone project's main focus was to make an AI-based recipe generator that functions by feeding it available ingredients and establishing limits or constraints to the dish. We integrated this into a website that 'invents' new recipes by considering the user's dietary needs and choice of cuisine. The recipe's ingredients, instructions, and AI-generated image is displayed to the user. The project implemented OpenAI's GPT-4 and DALLE-3 APIs into a Django Framework that is connected to a local MySQL database.

**2-3 Trees - Self Balancing Binary Trees**

Regular binary trees tend to get 'unbalanced' when data is inserted or deleted. Since the data is no longer equally distributed, the time complexity of data retrieval/queries will start to degrade. 2-3 trees hold data within nodes that can hold up to two values, and they automatically split and merge to maintain a constant balance in the tree. Thus, 2-3 trees are optimal in databases that update often, as constant stream of inputs and outputs will not cause an imbalance in the tree.

## **Education**
Computer Science: Cyber Security and Privacy Option, BS

## **Other things about me**
In my free time, I like do digital art and animations. I had a lot of fun designing the logo/mascot of my team's capstone project in my Senior year. For the website, I even animated a .gif consisting of 16 frames.
