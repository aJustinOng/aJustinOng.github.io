# **Hello there, I'm Justin!**

### Developer/Artist/Creator

I am an aspiring software engineer with entry-level professional experience in application development. I have worked with Java, Python, and C++. I am currently a Senior at Southern Arkansas University, with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.

## **Work Experience**

### App Dev Intern @ J.B. Hunt Transport

Over the course of a two-month long internship, I was assigned multiple stories relating to maintaining and updating a shipping/booking application. I worked closely with a mentor within a full-time team and participated in their two-week sprints.

The application used Java in a Spring Boot architecture and was deployed into Azure Dev Ops pipelines.

### CS Research Assistant @ Southern Arkansas University

Assisting my professor in research projects, with a focus on ViT (vision transformers) object detection. Primarily using Python and its libraries.

### Peer Tutor @ Southern Arkansas University

In-person supplemental tutoring to peers for classes I have previously taken such as Computer Science, Calculus, and Physics.

## **Projects**

**KAMI (Kitchen Assistant and Meal Innovator) - AI Recipe Generator**

This capstone project's main focus was to make an AI-based recipe generator that functions by feeding it with available ingredients and establishing limits or constraints to the dish. We integrated this into a website that 'invents' new recipes by considering the user's dietary needs and choice of cuisine.

The recipe's ingredients, instructions, and AI-generated image are displayed to the user. The project implemented OpenAI's GPT-4 and DALLE-3 APIs into a Django Framework that is connected to a local MySQL database.

**2-3 Trees - Self Balancing Binary Trees**

Regular binary trees tend to get 'unbalanced' when data is inserted or deleted. Since the data is no longer equally distributed, the time complexity of data retrieval/queries will start to degrade. 2-3 trees hold data within nodes that can hold up to two values, and they automatically split and merge to maintain a constant balance in the tree.

Thus, 2-3 trees are optimal in databases that update often, as constant stream of inputs and outputs will not cause an imbalance in the tree.

## **Other things about me**
In my free time, I like do digital art and animations. I had a lot of fun designing the logo/mascot of my team's capstone project in my Senior year.
