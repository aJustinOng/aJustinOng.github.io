## **Work Experience**

### App Dev Intern @ J.B. Hunt Transport

In this paid, in-person internship, I participated in multiple 2-week sprints with a full-time backend team. We focused on updating and maintaining the 360 Shipper application, where I was assigned stories on EUM calls cleanup, removing and replacing legacy code with modern APIs.

The application was based on the Java Spring Boot framework, and we used Git requests to collaborate through Azure DevOps Services. We also utilized Postman API and Dynatrace to test our services.

### CS Research Assistant @ Southern Arkansas University

I assisted in several machine learning research projects, specifically ViT (vision transformers) object detection. Python and its libraries (Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, CUDA) were utilized for our projects.

### Peer Tutor @ Southern Arkansas University

In the Academic Enrichment Center, I worked as an in-person supplemental tutor to peers, providing tailored support to individuals who required assistance in mastering their course material. This role honed my communication and leadership skills.

## **Projects**

### KAMI (Kitchen Assistant and Meal Innovator) - AI Recipe Generator

This capstone project's main focus was to make an AI-based recipe generator that functions by feeding it with available ingredients and establishing limits or constraints to the dish. We integrated this into a website that 'invents' new recipes by considering the user's dietary needs and choice of cuisine.

The recipe's ingredients, instructions, and AI-generated image are displayed to the user. The project implemented OpenAI's GPT-4 and DALLE-3 APIs into a Django Framework that is connected to a local MySQL database.

### LLM SPAM or HAM Classification

As an Honors project for my Cyber Forensics class, I decided to test the ability of different LLMs (Large Language Models) to classify spam emails in a zero-shot environment. Five models—Llama2, Mistral, Synthia, Zephyr, and CausalLM—were given the same dataset of spam and ham emails and instructed to classify them accordingly.

I downloaded and hosted the models on LM Studio and used the OpenAI API to connect them to a Python .ipynb notebook.

## **Other things about me**

In my free time, I like do digital art and animations. I had a lot of fun designing the logo/mascot of my team's capstone project in my Senior year, where I even created a .gif animation consisting of 16 hand-drawn frames.
