## **Projects**

### KAMI (Kitchen Assistant and Meal Innovator) - AI Recipe Generator

This capstone project's main focus was to make an AI-based recipe generator that functions by feeding it with available ingredients and establishing limits or constraints to the dish. We integrated this into a website that 'invents' new recipes by considering the user's dietary needs and choice of cuisine.

The recipe's ingredients, instructions, and AI-generated image are displayed to the user. The project implemented OpenAI's GPT-4 and DALLE-3 APIs into a Django Framework that is connected to a local MySQL database.

### LLM SPAM or HAM Classification

As an Honors project for my Cyber Forensics class, I decided to test the ability of different LLMs (Large Language Models) to classify spam emails in a zero-shot environment. Five models—Llama2, Mistral, Synthia, Zephyr, and CausalLM—were given the same dataset of spam and ham emails and instructed to classify them accordingly.

I downloaded and hosted the models on LM Studio and used the OpenAI API to connect them to a Python .ipynb notebook.

## **Skills**

### Data Visualization

The following is a simple interactive data visualization of the wages of computer science jobs between 2020-2023. I created this while learning and experimenting with Tableau.

As a research assistant, I had to explore different ways of visualizing data. I utilized Python libraries and Jupyter Notebook during our machine learning projects.

### Technical Writing

I believe that technical writing skills are vital in the Computer Science field, to report documents professionally. I have written some technical documents outside of my CS projects to develop these skills.

## **Other things about me**

In my free time, I like do digital art and animations. Creative projects have always been my interest.

I had a lot of fun designing the logo/mascot of my team's capstone project in my Senior year, where I even created a .gif animation consisting of 16 hand-drawn frames.
