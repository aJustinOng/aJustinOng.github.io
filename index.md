## **Work Experience**

### App Dev Intern @ J.B. Hunt Transport

In this paid, in-person internship, I participated in multiple 2-week sprints with a full-time backend team. We focused on updating and maintaining the 360 Shipper application, where I was assigned stories on EUM calls cleanup, removing and replacing legacy code with modern APIs.

The application was based on the Java Spring Boot framework, and we used Git requests to collaborate through Azure DevOps Services. We also utilized Postman API and Dynatrace to test our services.

What I did:

- Participated in multiple 2-week sprints with a full-time backend team.  
- Updated and maintained the 360 Shipper application.  
- EUM calls cleanup, removing and replacing legacy code with modern APIs.  
- Application was based on a Java Spring Boot framework.  
- Collaboration through Azure DevOps Services with Git.  
- Utilized Postman API and Dynatrace to test services.

## **Projects**

### KAMI (Kitchen Assistant and Meal Innovator) - AI Recipe Generator

This capstone project's main focus was to make an AI-based recipe generator that functions by feeding it with available ingredients and establishing limits or constraints to the dish. We integrated this into a website that 'invents' new recipes by considering the user's dietary needs and choice of cuisine.

The recipe's ingredients, instructions, and AI-generated image are displayed to the user. The project utilized OpenAI's GPT-4 and DALLE-3 APIs into a Django Framework that is connected to a local MySQL database. I was in charge of the front-end design as well as database design and management.

### Sales Insights using PowerBI

**Skills:**
SQL | DAX | Data Visualization

**Tools:**
MySQL Workbench | Microsoft Excel | PowerBI

I first used MySQL Workbench and Excel to clean and ETL a sales dataset. I then used PowerBI to analyze and visualize the revenue and profit across different regions, customers, and markets. I learned to focus on the critical areas (profit rather than revenue, etc.) that a sales manager would be interested in to answer and tackle sales problems. I used basic DAX to return specific data aggregates that could be used in visualizations. I also learned how to integrate the powerful filtering tools in PowerBI to allow my stakeholders to conveniently isolate data within specific conditions.

### LLM SPAM or HAM Classification

As an Honors project for my Cyber Forensics class, I decided to test the ability of different LLMs (Large Language Models) to classify spam emails in a zero-shot environment. Five models—Llama2, Mistral, Synthia, Zephyr, and CausalLM—were given the same dataset of spam and ham emails and instructed to classify them accordingly.

I installed and hosted the models on LM Studio and used the OpenAI API to connect them to a Python .ipynb notebook.

### 2-3 Tree Data Structure

This was a group project for a Data Structures & Algorithms class in my Sophomore year of university. It is a basic exploration of the 2-3 Trees data structure, a complex version of binary trees.

Regular binary trees tend to get "unbalanced" after data is inserted or removed. This means that all data are pushed to one side of the binary tree instead of being equally distributed, which increases the time complexity of data retrieval and queries. 2-3 trees do not have this issue because of the way they store data. Nodes that hold data within 2-3 trees can hold up to two values, and they split and merge in a way that maintains a constant balance in the tree. Thus, 2-3 trees are a more effective form of binary trees in databases that constantly update, as the stream of inputs and outputs will not cause an imbalance in the tree.

## **Skills**

### Data Visualization

The following is a simple interactive data visualization of the wages of computer science jobs between 2020-2023. I created this while learning and experimenting with Tableau.

Here's my simple take on the classic Tableau Sample Superstore dataset:

As a research assistant, I had to explore different ways of visualizing data. I utilized Python libraries and Jupyter Notebook during our machine learning projects.

### Technical Writing

I believe that technical writing skills are vital in the Computer Science field, to report documents professionally. I have written some technical documents outside of my CS projects to develop these skills.

During my Technical Writing class, I wrote a sample proposal where I sent out digital surveys on a potential product and fully analyzed and researched that topic with both primary and secondary sources. Then I designed the proposal in an aesthetic yet informative document.

I also had the opportunity to write a sample memorandum to my professor, analyzing the technical effectiveness of a particular product I was familar with.

## **Other things about me**

In my free time, I like do digital art and animations. Creative projects have always been my interest.

I had the opportunity to design the logo/mascot of my Senior capstone project, where I even created a .gif animation consisting of 16 hand-drawn frames.
